# IBM Z Datathon

This project was part of a 24 hour hackathon. As a group of four, we attempted to predict the magnitude of forest fires using a combination of a regression based model (experimenting with an MLP and a random forest) and a image classification model. The underpinning theory or hypothesis was that we could apply a weighting to the probability output of the image classification and regression models to create a more informaed predictor. 

Unfortunately due to the lack of data and time, the project was not completed. Areas for future improvement:

1. Find a large dataset of forest fire images for image classification
2. Properly define the magnitude of forest fires - too vague of a definition.

New area of focus - Predict the total financial loss from a forest fire for insurance companies using the same techniques.
